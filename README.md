<h1>Learning to Play Magic: The Gathering</h1>


This project is intended to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods to attempt to learn how to optimally play Magic with certain decks. The program will allow a user to pick 2 different decks that the user and the opponent will use. The user can choose if 
they will play the game, or if the AI agent will play the game and learn a specific decklist. 

While most likely not optimal, learning will be performed via deck vs. deck. For example, the agent will learn Izzet Phoenix vs. Azorius Control, but if it faces Rakdos Midrange, it will not perform and will need to relearn.


Planned machine learning/AI methods:
- Q-Learning
- TD-Learning
- Minimax w/ Alpha-Beta Pruning


Planned features:
- Allow a user to set up a desired game state and get a response on what card to play based upon prior learning
